Is to come up with: Mini Project - Basic Login System: Develop a program that allows users to register, login, and logout with basic authentication.

All team members include:
CDTC0302, CDTC0287, CDTC0035, CDTC0420, CDTC0402 and CDTC0219

Before the end of April, 2024, we should all have completed the project.

I wish us all the very best, in this journey.
